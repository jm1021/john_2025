## Game Idea

A learning adventure.

The player (turtle) will live start in a water worlkd with GitHub and Linux and progress to Jupyter and JavaScript land world.  There will be NPC characters in the each world that will help the turtle solve CompSci problems until he is able to leave the world.  There could be a second player, that you can compete against.

Interaction will require proximety and will stop game from time/destruction.  There will need to be input support for game intractions and game results.  Results will be stored in local storage and there will be a time based history for user(s).  Solve all the problems from the NPCs and you can leave the world and progress until Game Over.
